![demo](https://github.com/HamadAljawder/DarkMode4Bahrain.bh/blob/main/demo.png)

## Setup
- Download the .zip file & extract the folder.
- go to [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) and enable 'Developer mode' on the top right.
- Click on 'Load unpacked' on the top left of the screen and choose the 'DarkMode4Bahrain.bh' folder extracted previously.
- Enable the extension and visit [Bahrain.bh](https://bahrain.bh).


### To Do
- Fix the white flashes during page transitions, which only affects the old Bahrain.bh website design as they're not using ajax.
- support 'apps.bahrain.bh'
- support more websites of the government.
